This Prework Study Guide Webpage was created to have a quick resource to refer to when creating webpages. The webpage enabled me to practice different functions of Github, and to learn the basic syntax of webpages. I learned the basic layout and connections of different assets neccessary to create a webpage. I learned how to style a page with a seperate CSS file, which is then linked to the main HTML file. I learned how to pull and push my files to Github. I learned how to research different errors and unknown functions. Building this webpage solved the issue of understanding the basic ideas behind web development.
